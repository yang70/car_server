## Problem Domain
Entertaining children (and parents!) on long road trips can be tricky, especially if you don't have unlimited cell phone data.  When at home, I have a home media server with my movie collection that makes watching movies a breeze.  Would there be a way to have a similar solution in the car?

## Description
This project is my attempt to create a media server for my car that serves video/music from an attached hard drive to multiple devices via wifi.  

## Hardware
* [Raspberry Pi 2](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/)
* [Canakit Wifi dongle](http://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-wifi.html)

## Software
* [Raspbian - Jessie](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/)
* [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/)(OK maybe overkill, but I love Rails!)

## Configuration
* [Creating wifi hotspot with Raspberry Pi](https://learn.adafruit.com/setting-up-a-raspberry-pi-as-a-wifi-access-point/install-software)
